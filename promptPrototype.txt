[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] There we go.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. So updating the recap feature page.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] With some of the new stuff,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] We're talking about on the recap

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] section of the main page, like have one of the squares updated with

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] the engagement stats. I think we have one of them today, which is already.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Engagement stats, we can just review if that needs to be.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] If there's copy that needs to be changed or whether we need

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] a new graphic or something or whether we need to add you like, a new block at the bottom?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Which just shows some the engagement sets in in a different way.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] But but yeah, recap. And then, yeah, we have some comparison

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] pages that we wanna create.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Is there... Do we do you have any ideas about

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] about this yet, just?

[Cheska from Butter] I think those

[Cheska from Butter] things I was thinking about one is including it

[Cheska from Butter] as there can see I've completed

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] You've updated to, I see.

[Cheska from Butter] yeah.

[Cheska from Butter] It's happened to me in some calls in demos. Actually it's quite cute.

[Cheska from Butter] Should in the pricing page, itself

[Cheska from Butter] just mentioning upfront, like, what what are the tools for your place and how much they're saving?

[Cheska from Butter] By going into butter and then also having

[Cheska from Butter] versus pages. So, like, similarly to our, we have butter versus zoom now

[Cheska from Butter] pick a more lightweight version of that on butter versus

[Cheska from Butter] But our versus type form was better versus session yeah, whatever

[Cheska from Butter] like, some of the tools that we we actually replace.

[Cheska from Butter] So I'll be working on the car

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] had a question

[Cheska from Butter] b structure and copy sheet for that this week.

[Cheska from Butter] And then maybe pass on you guys.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Got the word

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Are we thinking about making one... Like, so butter compared to

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] type form other compared to session lab or

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] what about? Like, in my mind it was, like,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] other and then there are all of these different tools.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] That can kind of

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] well, replace somehow.

[Cheska from Butter] On

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Just

[Cheska from Butter] On the overview... Sorry. Sorry. I.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] just thinking...

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Seems like it'll be a lot of

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Unsure if we go down on, like each individual

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] two... Like, pages... Because again,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] once we go tool to tool Session lab has a lot more when it comes to agenda

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Right? And all a sudden, you'll be comparing that one thing because it's a full page

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] on that. Whereas if it's just like in a group of

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] tools that we replace

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] it can be on an overall level somehow. I don't know if if if anyone else have.

[Kasper Andersen] had a comment

[Kasper Andersen] Got the word

[Kasper Andersen] But on those right

[Kasper Andersen] pay this kind of. I don't know how to say it.

[Kasper Andersen] Kind of pun it anyway. It's like just us putting ourselves in a better light and the other

[Kasper Andersen] tools doesn't really matter if session like

[Kasper Andersen] can do stocks that we can. We just won't mention that on the

[Kasper Andersen] or page because it's about Seo and

[Kasper Andersen] during our features. Like I would at least imagine that.

[Kasper Andersen] Whenever we do a new page, we have to decide okay.

[Kasper Andersen] This is a one off page or do we want more than one of the same page? And then it needs

[Kasper Andersen] be, and then then all of them needs to be the same structure.

[Kasper Andersen] Otherwise, it's going to be mobile. Right? So

[Kasper Andersen] think if we could make it template where it's like,

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah. The part versus assumed page is not

[Kasper Andersen] I we should be inspired. But that was pretty quickly made right. So it's also

[Kasper Andersen] not that pretty and it's not connected to any Cms. So

[Kasper Andersen] So if we can make Like it simply, then

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] But that is if we don't already have

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] page structure that could work right.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So, like, if you could reuse the feature page, for example.

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah. Yeah. But but this

[Kasper Andersen] you don't really reuse anything, like it's... Of course, easier if we take the design

[Kasper Andersen] feature, but You still have to copy it over and set it all up. So we don't have to

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Okay.

[Kasper Andersen] we create stuff, but it's not like as because it's them a new

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Okay.

[Kasper Andersen] Cms type we have to set up. But it's very faster than just

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] By my only reflection of my only concern and going into this is how much

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] time we'll be spending... Building multiple pages and setting up template

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] and, like for for for doing

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] for doing this and how much time we'll be spending on, you know,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] creating creating the actual comparisons and the copy, what is it that we're comparing because

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] we will need to look into features on... Of course, our own side, but also on

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] competitor sites to actually share something that's not... You know, I understand that there's a

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] certain level of Ps in those pages, but it can't be like well,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] this is not what this product does where people actually

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] like c right to. And it needs to have

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] some form of validity where people don't call Bs the moment to read the first line.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So there is a... That's that's kind of the way

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] or the balancing that needs to happen.

[Cheska from Butter] had a comment

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. So so

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I don't know. So that that that would be my only question as

[Cheska from Butter] Got the word

[Cheska from Butter] I think no one I'll pick.

[Cheska from Butter] Thanks gasp. No. No. I'll take that into consideration what

[Cheska from Butter] fix are seeing. I think we can also batch

[Cheska from Butter] like the more important one is all almost like feature pricing because that's immediate thing that

[Cheska from Butter] people would would need to have

[Cheska from Butter] would need to be convinced off how much they're saving and the tools

[Cheska from Butter] versus how much they will be paying for butter.

[Cheska from Butter] And then for the comparison pages, we can either do it

[Cheska from Butter] a per tool or on a plan run.

[Cheska from Butter] Sort of thing make list out, what are the tools we can potentially your place for

[Cheska from Butter] part of the journey. But I'm not too sure. Like, if the main thing we're considering is also seo,

[Cheska from Butter] that I don't think that would completely address it. So

[Cheska from Butter] let me... I'll I'll give it a think and then it'll come up several options.

[Cheska from Butter] If we do decide to go to the specific page

[Cheska from Butter] And actually, you I will keep it super duper lean

[Cheska from Butter] not clean like, much much shorter.

[Cheska from Butter] More condensed compared to butter versus zoom in as she mentioned

[Cheska from Butter] and it if possible. Okay.

[Cheska from Butter] Any any other

[Cheska from Butter] Thanks for website.

[Cheska from Butter] I also listed that down how to, but I think that's a different

[Cheska from Butter] works, to how to video and help.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] How to videos is... Yeah. It's a separate thing. Right?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I don't have anything else for website, I think.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I like the idea of doing

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] block or some section of the pricing page

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] that just lists. Thank you.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Stop using, like, gathering treat pack, and

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] you can do that butter. Doing this, you can do this in butter.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Don't use Because you can run poles and butter, all of those things.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Could be like a a nice short where you could

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] put logos in, like consolidate your

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] workflow in butter and get rid of these things.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I think that would be a really nice way because I think that is also where people

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] we'll go into evaluate whether something for them.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] If that's a section that's

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] shows to be interesting. I guess that could all be copied on two different pages.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So use case page, you can have that same section.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Okay. So you're running training logs, training sessions.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] These are probably the top five tools that they... Most of them use.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Let's add them in there and say consolidate it's better so. That could be, like a lightweight approach

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] we would need to be to build a full page, but we build a

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] section or element that I guess would be easy. More easily,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] adaptable and and easier to copy from page to page.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So let's do something to consider, I guess.

[Cheska from Butter] Stupid question rent for

[Cheska from Butter] for casper. Like, it's... Those blocks are we can

[Cheska from Butter] it right.

[Kasper Andersen] Which

[Kasper Andersen] I mean,

[Cheska from Butter] We have similar to how we have the footer on sign up

[Cheska from Butter] Not photo the the banner before the footer is it possible to those blocks.

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah. We we can we can size everything and

[Kasper Andersen] just depends on I don't think I totally get

[Kasper Andersen] your Kristen do. It depends on

[Kasper Andersen] because the template is something else. It's, like, more of a page. Right?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Started a tool: Whiteboard

[Kasper Andersen] That we can... But there's not really templates in. Loads more connect

[Kasper Andersen] it through Cms. And then when you write something in,

[Kasper Andersen] then it's just used

[Kasper Andersen] but we should try to keep as much as possible in the Cms.

[Kasper Andersen] Because components is just

[Kasper Andersen] something I use when I designed the page,

[Kasper Andersen] So... Yeah. Guess.

[Kasper Andersen] I don't think I do question. But we can everything, But

[Kasper Andersen] I don't really see if I don't see

[Kasper Andersen] a place where you are going to touch those components because then

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So I think I just opened it up... So if you look at

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] the three blocks here as a as one page

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Right. Where the top one here, casper piece correct if Wrong.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] This would be the pricing table, for example, And then you would have... This one down here is our current

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] comparison matrix. Right? So the bottom one here. Comparison

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] matrix.

[Kasper Andersen] Are we on the pricing page? Now?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. This pricing page just as an example. Yeah.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So pricing table at the top, and then the suggestion here was

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] say, okay, let's make a section that has to do with

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] truly comparison. Right?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So I guess, the way that this... Are you building this as a

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] as a component or as a section, or would this be easy to

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] safe. We've built this in one place, we could say

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] on the... So if there is a feature page here,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] or a use case

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] there's not a a page but it's a header And this full page, you could say

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] we can copy this over and make

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] a few changes to this one over here, but the structure of that block

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] would essentially be the same... Yep.

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah. This is what we already

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yep.

[Kasper Andersen] do. What I mean is, like, you can't, like,

[Kasper Andersen] let's say that this was the feature page. Right? You can

[Kasper Andersen] take that whole page and say, now it's just use case page.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Dirty.

[Kasper Andersen] You create on new page page and then you copy paste every

[Kasper Andersen] think over. And if it's a component or not, that's just more on my work.

[Kasper Andersen] Flow. It doesn't really matter. You can just, you know,

[Kasper Andersen] As you just did here. Market copy then.

[Kasper Andersen] Command with, and then it works for you, like,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yep.

[Kasper Andersen] So... Yeah, in all the stuff we already have.

[Kasper Andersen] It's it's super easy easy to do. But it's... What I mean is it's

[Kasper Andersen] I still need an hour to to actually do the copy pasting because

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah. We're close to it sometimes because

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] F.

[Kasper Andersen] if I said this this thing is set up to a

[Kasper Andersen] Cms, then I have to take out all the Cms and then copy paste. You can just copy

[Kasper Andersen] So that's me that's more of a hacking

[Kasper Andersen] web workflow kind of thing. But... Yeah. Whatever we have is super easy to do and that

[Kasper Andersen] what we already did with... I think use case pages and feed

[Kasper Andersen] to pay this uses a lot of the same.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] This how clarify Chess?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Great.

[Kasper Andersen] Good I'm doing.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Thank you. It's amazing how people preach

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] that illustrations and just putting stuff down on paper actually help

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Stopped tool: Whiteboard

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] with getting people in the same table. It works.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Cool.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So today? Just as a quick note. I think

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I'm... I just set up a draft to

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] announce, you know, the engagement features. So what I'm doing is I am

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] just recording a short video that we can add into it, which

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] will be, like, a walk through like, I'll scrolls to one of our

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] sprint kickoff sessions just because that has a lot

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] the engagement data, which are without anything being sensitive in there. Right?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So we can show

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] just on his stuff. I won't show in session because that's

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] be difficult to do. When you're only one person, otherwise you need to organize

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] multiple people, but I'll just let people know that.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Can be done in session. Need to figure out if you don't show how that can be done.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I'll focus this to be a

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Well, an update video, we could potentially also use it on social media,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] which which may be good. I'll be using

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] some of the... I was

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] to use... On on remembering how to best implement the template intro

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] stuff that you created. So might

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] if if I... For some reason, don't get that working, I might just

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] pin you to to assist with that. Hopefully, that

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] That is okay.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] But... Yeah. So that's one thing that's that's coming out today.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And then I think just for how videos would be good to

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] to create how to video for that as well as down the line.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And we'll need to write up the release notes

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] and

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] The recap help dock

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] only thing missing in house assets for that. I

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] think I've created most missed copy for it.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And then creating a separate page for

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] engagement analytics that we can also point

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] from the recap page where people can dive into... So what are the individual

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] shots, graphs, whatever showing. I think that would be a nice little thing to

[Kasper Andersen] had a comment

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] have for people.

[Kasper Andersen] Got the word

[Kasper Andersen] Just a quick note on. I don't know if you know it, but when you

[Kasper Andersen] create a Cms item you can schedule the post,

[Kasper Andersen] So if you know that you want tomorrow, then you can just do today, and then it would

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. That's... I think that's as soon as you go into the save or

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] publish, I think there is a... Or I don't know if it's if it if it is

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] you set the date or something like this that it's schedules. But, yeah, that that's pretty nice

[Kasper Andersen] Just

[Kasper Andersen] just on the date in in

[Kasper Andersen] in there now. It's not that important anymore. It's mostly because

[Kasper Andersen] had to date all the old ones while uploading everything in add once

[Kasper Andersen] but yet. So as long as it's just

[Kasper Andersen] same ish. It's not... It's only connected to higher see in the page.

[Kasper Andersen] It's not connected to add the whole Api or the

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Got it. I think that's it.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And on my end. I don't know if there's anything else

[Cheska from Butter] For me just

[Cheska from Butter] for engagement analytics, or released

[Cheska from Butter] we're thinking of doing a bit of a agreed recap

[Cheska from Butter] like, what you've updated recap and then we type on that.

[Cheska from Butter] On October nineteenth.

[Cheska from Butter] Not to sure if few guys are okay with that time.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Efficient?

[Cheska from Butter] Yeah. Like a bit of an intro event.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] October nineteenth... Do we wanna

[Cheska from Butter] Ideally if we have recording trimming, I think that would also be like

[Cheska from Butter] things that in terms of recap that we've improved since the last time, so

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. Okay. So what we have in the

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] time the upcoming releases... Adam is working on highlights.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Right? Sam is just tweaking engagement analytics. I think there's some

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] stuff coming out there still.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Recording trimming, Tucker is

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I I think he's polishing.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Is the Qa speed might be reduced since s,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] is out, right for the next two weeks, I think it is. She's

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] on holiday,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So I don't know if that... Or I don't know how it will impact.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] The Qa process.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] We also have the troubleshooting tool. I don't know. That's not related.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] To b caps. Right? But might be good to mention that as well. That's

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] out out for Qa now as well.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] In recap and then the highlights as Adam is

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] currently working on that, which males be interesting for us to I

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] to two. So yeah. I think maybe the nineteenth might be still a good

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] What date is that weekday?

[Cheska from Butter] Eighteenth. That's a first day. We can eat to do nineteenth or

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I think both Casper and I are out

[Cheska from Butter] twenties.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] and nineteenth. I think that's... Or is that the week after?

[Kasper Andersen] For Ama next week.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] You're at next week.

[Kasper Andersen] You're you're out the week

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Every week after. Because that's

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] it's fault vacation here in Denmark toe. Schools are.

[Cheska from Butter] Yeah. Then maybe twenty

[Cheska from Butter] either twenty five or twenty six also works. The twenty four we have shown until

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. I'm just wondering if there's a

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I I don't wanna push it that far. I and a month has passed and like, that

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] that's pretty precious time right now. So I'd rather

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] and don't... I'd honestly rather do it

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Next week, then push it far down.

[Cheska from Butter] Do we have highlights by then?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I don't care. Like, if like, honestly, we can we can

[Cheska from Butter] Okay.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] we can tell about it still. Like, we have ways to show that it's coming. So we can use it

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] to pipe it up. And

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So I'd I'd rather keep this swift and execute on it quickly rather than push it

[Cheska from Butter] Yeah.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] forward it because we want to see the effects of this as soon as possible.

[Cheska from Butter] Yeah.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And end a month from now is just like, that's too far away. Or twenty days, Like

[Cheska from Butter] That's

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] three weeks from now.

[Cheska from Butter] for... Sorry. Just so I I can also check on your... On file.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Holiday.

[Cheska from Butter] Holiday holiday.

[Cheska from Butter] And then I'll just send you guys a calendar.

[Cheska from Butter] Either I'm thinking either... We still need their on no b to promote twelve or

[Cheska from Butter] seventeen could work either of those two dates.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. And casper don't, I get

[Cheska from Butter] Okay.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] it's if you're a way, I'll take it. So don't worry if you're not... If you're not in.

[Kasper Andersen] It's my Honeymoon. So I think Lot will be a bit

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. Okay.

[Kasper Andersen] Mad for doing.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I'll I'll I'll leave you to please focus

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] sun undo for those days.

[Kasper Andersen] But again, we it also works the other way around it. If

[Kasper Andersen] it works better than Chris Result we can also do it.

[Kasper Andersen] Just also... I think it worked pretty well when we did the at the agenda where we

[Kasper Andersen] of the hat feet features coming up, like just during it

[Kasper Andersen] when we are really integrating for the went pretty well because it also kind of affects

[Kasper Andersen] of it, I guess, To follow on

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. I guess the good thing about it is also the kind

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] produces content that we can share afterwards.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Right? So there's material where we can cut from sessions

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] afterwards and and share on social media. So

[Kasper Andersen] It would be cool if we could share highlights from that session.

[Kasper Andersen] So if you're actually add highlights,

[Cheska from Butter] There's no mind blown.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Very true.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] No. That will be that would be crazy. Right? If you just continue to click

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] the the big frame that in the big one, it would just explode

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Be crazy.

[Cheska from Butter] But I... That's it. On my plate, we also have the show seat.

[Cheska from Butter] S Cr. So if you guys want to join Fairs stat

[Cheska from Butter] what they're touching on is primarily, like design.

[Cheska from Butter] And then on sales, I'll just do a loom update.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] If do you have any questions on that on the sales process at the moment?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Okay. Cool.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] On the video stuff,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] the intro... Is that on lead

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] that that we

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] create that. Is that where it lives? Or is it in canada or if you remember

[Cheska from Butter] It's on v.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And we can also change the assets there on the

[Cheska from Butter] Mh. Yeah.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] it's just... I didn't... Like, of course, figure out once you sit down and undo it, but it's

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] it feels like every time I need to sit down and do it. I need to blur it again, which just makes it

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] unnecessarily long winded.

[Kasper Andersen] had a comment

[Kasper Andersen] Got the word

[Kasper Andersen] Got the word

[Kasper Andersen] Just on that note, we we still have

[Kasper Andersen] all the how to videos in wheat. We just

[Kasper Andersen] have to remember that there is a supply book where doesn't really work with weed.

[Kasper Andersen] In app. Don't really know

[Kasper Andersen] a priority to move it to Youtube. But at some point, we'll probably have to do that.

[Kasper Andersen] All we wait for Apples to fix it.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Does v have the auto translate Ai

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] f. Like, the sync sync syncing

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] it's old. Yeah. But I'm thinking I'm thinking

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] you know, the the stuff where Jacob and speak Spanish?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And Chinese.

[Kasper Andersen] They must be fourteen a few months.

[Kasper Andersen] I can't imagine it's not like somewhere.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] You know. I... Again, it's probably also one of those Like it won't make

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] too much of an impact right now, but

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] do we have any form of usage view stats on the videos?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Or does speed not

[Cheska from Butter] We have on the page un feed itself. We don't have the

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Okay.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] If we upload videos in

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] batches. We can also use the in app product announcement just

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] to show, like, new videos and link people to the updates. Right?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I think one thing that's... I think it's really good for

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] because we're able to actually write a bit more stuff that we'll show for people.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And now the the little dot

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] thingy has also been updated so when you click it. It it opens the app

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] portal. Which really nice. So

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So let's just let's get into the habit of

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] and

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I we should. If not, that's one of the things we

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] they need to set up, But I think we have

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] But let's let's check. Let's check.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Does it count on

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] because it is also a page. Right. It's an embedded page.

[Cheska from Butter] Yeah.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] So question is if there is if we're tracking just the

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] opened embedded version as a view,

[Cheska from Butter] I think we just have discussed right now in a Ga, we're only track.

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah.

[Cheska from Butter] In app dot butter butter dot Us. But we don't track the other sub domains.

[Cheska from Butter] So we can just add it then, I think.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Think that would be good.

[Cheska from Butter] Okay.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] And if that counts both the in app

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I guess, one thing is, of course, challenging is that if

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] automatically shows whenever there's a new one that doesn't mean that people have

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] seen it. Right? I don't know if we can actually exchange

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah. It's it really... Yeah. For the product updates. I guess,

[Kasper Andersen] it's not really the goal to get people to open it. It's more like it's right in your face.

[Kasper Andersen] Because can you actually ever open butter now?

[Kasper Andersen] The dashboard without seeing it. I don't think you really can.

[Kasper Andersen] Because it just opens right.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] No. Exactly. And you cannot turn it off, which is amazing.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. No. So maybe

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] But I think just in general tracking, I don't know. Probably good to track it in years.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Just. If you can add it as c separate extension.

[Cheska from Butter] That mixed mixed I, I'm not too sure how do I... But

[Cheska from Butter] if if we need to track... But I don't think we need to track like as Casper mentioned just

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I don't know if it also made sense for us to

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] if there's a show tell series, for example, like, a day before or something like that doing it a

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] and we need to figure out so it doesn't open

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] every time you open up butter with new information. Right? Because then you'll just, like, automatically close it.

[Cheska from Butter] Yeah.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] But I do think, like, if there's this show and tell and it's coming up in two days.

[Cheska from Butter] That would be

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] You could host it. As as an update.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Tags.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Yeah. Yeah. But we have... But it will only show for people in in butter. Right?

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] But we have tags, I guess, Casper like, you created it from updates,

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] for events and presented it. So

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] if we end up doing so, we could think about adding a way to shelter.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Between types of updates

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] on the embedded At one point. I don't think it's this necessary now, but if we

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] using it like this, This could be a consideration.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Okay. Cool. I would just brainstorm some. I don't know I don't have

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] too much other stuff.

[Kasper Andersen] had a comment

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Did we capture everything? Yep.

[Kasper Andersen] Got the word

[Kasper Andersen] Got the word

[Kasper Andersen] Yeah. Just me just have. It'll look at my latest.

[Kasper Andersen] Post in product design. I did loom about event pages.

[Cheska from Butter] So Chris, something for percent review. Not pro. I was tagged. So

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] Much?

[Cheska from Butter] You tagged something on product experiment. So I'll just look through san of.

[Chris from Butter ğŸ‘‹] I... Yeah. Yeah. That's fine.
