This project was made with the rest of the team at <a href="http://www.detnyesort.dk" target="_blank">Det nye sort.</a>

Xtel is developing and researching for solutions in embedded and wireless technology. They are a team of great engineers and work on a lot of complicated projects. Xtel do a lot of stuff that normal people wont understand, even some of their potential new coustumers would have a hard time understanding it. The mission was to make Xtel more understandable and human. We wanted to show that Xtel is a company driven by people and not computers. We wanted to make a cold company into a warm and noticeable company. But at the same time showing them as a professional and hard working company.

We did this by picking some warm colors and showing the people of Xtel on every page. We worked with three diffrents colors to symbolize the three main cores in Xtel: Technology(dark blue), Buisness(yellow) and People(red).

We also tried to make the site accessible for two kinds of target groupes. The first target is new costumer who needed an easy overview of Xtel. The second target is the experienced costumer who wanted to read more about Xtel and all the complex stuf they are doing.
We did this by starting every page with a intro text, this intro should be enough for the costumer to have an overview of the subject.
Then if you read beyond the intro, then the text will become more and more comple and the costumer will be presentet with key numbers, graphs, etc.

The last goal was to make them look like a modern company. We did this by making the site fully responsive, with a good mobile page, and using animation around the site to give the design some depth
